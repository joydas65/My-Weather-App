# My-Weather-App
It's a web app that's purely developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript. No frameworks is used.
Features of the app include
i) Shows different information like sunrise, sunset time, temperature, wind speed etc.
ii) Before loading all these information, a loading spinner is added.
iii) If user has blocked access, then a push message at bottom of the page is displayed to give access to it.
iv) Sunrise and sunset time logic. Which means if current time is less than sunrise time it won't show sunrise and sunset time.
If current time is greater than sunrise time but less than sunset time it'll show sunrise time and not the sunset time and else it'll show both the timings.
v) The page is mobile responsive and is tested for all kinds of mobile devices.
vi) Predicts chance of rain for next 7 days and shows it in the form of a chart.
